# DEBUGGING

The ideal: prevent bugs all together

How to Identify Bugs

- ran the code, looked at errors messages
  - line #
  - what kind of error (message itself)
- console.log values — work our way logically through the code until we get to the point where it doesn't work
- walk through your - pretend you are the computer reading the code. What are the values at each step, are they what they should be?
- linter - look for swigglies (red underline)
- 2nd set of eyes
- put in a ticket for a TA in Remo
- take a break change persepective
- Google the error message — stack Overflow
- read the docs!!!!
- meaningful comments
- get proof of life at every step while you developing
— ask ChatGBT a question
